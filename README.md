This is a collection of codes used to practice various python techniques to help me learn how to code with python.
I learnt about these technique through modules in the Whitecliffes Software Development Fundamentals Paper Online.
To run the codes download python 3.11.1 at this link https://www.python.org/downloads/
The files can be opened in IDLE Shell and then run if need be.
Please feel free to give me feedback and suggest what other techniques i could research and practice to help improve my coding.
In addition to the simpler codes, I have continued practicing while trying to create code for a helpdesk ticket system.
I began creating the helpdesk system before completeing all the learning modules. 
As I went through more modules my code changed to include these, for example the use of classes was a later module so i did not use classes in my initial code.
